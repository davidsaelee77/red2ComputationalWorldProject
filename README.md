TASK: 

Develop a simulation or game through all stages of the development cycle with focus on challenges related to simulations and games including the design and management of the simulation components, the design and deployment of a game engine to server and clients, the management of graphics and user control, and the design of computer controlled agents.

GOAL:

Identify the unique features and requirements of a simulation or game:

●Manage a large scale simulation and/or game development with multiple necessary components among:
  - real-time animation and graphics rendering;
  - simulation engine;○user controls;
  - autonomous agent controller;
  - multi-user networking;
  - simulation data storage and retrieval;
  - and/or server and client networking.
●Investigate modern game and simulation design patterns to effectively manage the scale of the deployment.
  - The update-render loop.
  - Server-client models.
  - Discrete and continuous game engines.
  - Agent focused design.
  
OUTCOME:
